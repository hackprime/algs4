10.1 1D RANGE SEARCH  (8:51)

Extension of ordered symbol table:
- insert key-value pair
- Search for key k
delete key k
RANGE SEARCH: find all keys between k1 and k2
RANGE COUNT: number of keys between k1 and k2

Example: database queries [find all car adverts with year made between 1999 and 2010]

Geometric interpretation:
- Keys are points on a line
- Find/count points in a given 1D (one dimension) interval

Implementations:
- array
    ORDER OF GROW of running time for 1d range search
    Unordered array:
        - insert: 1
        - range count: N
        - range search: N
    Ordered array:
        - insert: N
        - range count: log N
        - range search: R + log N
    Goal:
        - insert: log N
        - range count: log N
        - range search: R + log N
    * N = number of keys
    * R = number of keys that match
- BST
    RANGE COUNT
    rank of node - how many nodes is less than current
    Range count = rank of greather node (k2) - rank of lesser node (k1)
    Range count += 1 if k2 entry in the range query in the table
    -- Running time proportional to log N

    RANGE SEARCH
    - find all keys between k2 and k1
    - recursively find all keys in left subtree (if any could fall in range)
    - check key in current node
    - recursively find all keys in right subtree (if any could fall in range)



10.2 LINE SEGMENT INTERSECTION (5:46)

Given N horizontal and vertical line segments, find all intersections.

Brute Force: check all pairs of line segments for intersection (quadratic).
~nondegeneracy [невырожденность]
Nondegeneracy assumption: All x- an dy-coordinates are distinct.

>> ORTOGONAL LINE SEGMANT INTERSECTION SEARCH <<
[sweep line algorythm]
~sweep [сносить, сметать, уничтожать]

Idea: sweep vertical line from left to right
- x-coordinates define events
    > Sweep from left to right against x-coordinate (what's the next x coordinate).
- h-segment (left endpoint): insert y-coordinates into BST.
- h-segment (right endpoint): remove y-coordinates from BST.
- v-segment: range search for interval of y-endpoints.
    > Range search between y-coordinates of vertical line points

-- The sweep-line algorythm takes time proportional to N log N + R to find all R intersections among N orthogonal line segment
-- Sweep line reduces 2D orthogonal line segment intersection search to 1d range search



10.3 KD-TREES (29:07)

2D orthogonal range search
Extension of ordered symbol-table to 2d keys
- insert 2d key
- delete 2d key
- search for 2d key
- Range search: find all keys that lie in a 2d range.
- Range count: number of keys that lie in a 2d range.

Geometric interpretation:
- keys are point in a plane.
- find/count points in a given h-v (rectangle is axos-aligned) rectangle.
Useing in networking, circuit design, databases.
    Find all emploees whose salary is between 1000000 and 5000000 and age between 40 and 50.

Implementations
- GRID - divide space uniformly into squares
    Grid of squares
    - divide space between M-by-M grid of squares.
    - create list of points contained in each square.
    - use 2d array to directly index relevant square.
    - INSERT: add (x, y) to list with corresponding square
    - RANGE SEARCH: Examine only squares that intersect 2d range query

    Space-time tradeoff
    - Space: M^2 + N
    - Time: 1 + N/M^2 per square examined, on average

    Choose square size to tune performance:
    - Too small: wasted space
    - Too large: too any points per square
    - Rule of thumb: sqrt(N)-by-sqrt(N) grid

    Running time (if points are evenly distributed):
    - Initialize data structure
    - insert point: 1
    - Range search: 1 per point in range.
    --> In case of M ~ sqrt(N)

    Summary: Fast, simple solution for evenly-distruibuted points

    Problem - Clustering
         is well-known phenomenonin geometric data:
    - Lists are too long, even though average length is short
    - Need data structure that adapts gracefully to data

    EXAMPLE:
    - USA map, 13k cities, 1k squares in grid
    - half of squares are empty
    - 50% of the points in 10% of the squares

[SPACE-PARTITIONING TREES]

- 2D TREE - recursivelu divide space into two halfplanes
    Idea:
    - inserting point as node in tree
    - on every point draw a line, vertical and horisontal alternately
    - insert the next point:
        - if its on a left side or bellow from line: insert point to left subtree
        - if its on a right side or above from line: insert point to right subtree

    Data structure:
    - BST, but alternative using x- and y- coordinates as key
        (even level - vertical line, odd level - horizontal line)
    - Search giver rectangle containing point
    - insert further subdivides the plane

    Range search:
        ex: find all points in 2d tree that contained ib query rectangle
        GOAL: find all points in a query axis-aligned rectangle
        - check if point in node lies in given rectangle
        - recursively search left/bottom (if any could fall in rectangle)
        - recursively search right/top (if any could fall in rectangle)

        Running time:
        - Average case: R + log N
        - Worst case (assumed tree is balanced): R + sqrt(N)

    Nearest neighbour search:
        GOAL: find closest point  to query point
        - check distance from point in node to query point.
        - recursively search left/bottom (if it could contain a closer point)
        - recursively search right/top (if it could contain a closer point)
        - organize method so that it begins by searching for query point.

Boid (Bird-oid object) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids]
Rules of complex emergent flocking behavoir.
- Collision avoidance: point away from k nearest boids.
- Flock centering: point towards the center of mass of k nearest boids.
- Velocity matching: update velocity to tha average of k nearest boids.

KD tree:
- Recursively partition k-dimentional space into 2 halfspaces

Implementation:

- widely used

N-BODY SIMULATION
Goal: simulate the motion of N particles, mutually affected by gravity
~mutually [обоюдно, взаимно]

Brute force: for each pair of particles, compute force: F = (G * m1 * m2) / r^2

Key idea: Suppose particle is far, far away from cluster of particles
- treat cluster of particleas as a simple aggregate particle.
- compute force between particle and center of mass of aggregate.

Algorythm:
- build 3d tree with N particles as nodes.
- store center-of-mass of subtree in each node.
- to compute total force acting on a particle, traverse tree, but stop
  as soon as distance from particle to subdivision is sufficiently large.



10.4 INTERVAL SEARCH TREES (13:47)

1d interval search
- insert an interval (lo, hi)
- search for an interval (lo, hi)
- delete an interval (lo, hi)
- INTERVAL INTERSECTION QUERY: given an interval (lo, hi), find all intervals
  (or one interval) in date structure that intersects (lo, hi)

~nondegeneracy assumotion [предположение о невырожденности]

Nondegeneracy assumotion: No two intervals have the same left endpoint.

Create BST, where each node stores an interval (lo, hi)
    - Use left endpoint as BST key
    - store max endpoint in subtree rooted at node

INSERT (lo, hi):
- insert into BST: using lo as the key
- update max in each node on search path

SEARCH (lo, ho):
- if interval in node intersects query interval, return it.
- else if left subtree is null, go right.
- else if max endpoint in left subtree is less than lo, go right.
- else go left. (if ypu did not go right - go left)

If search goes right then no intersection in left.
- left subtree is empty - trivial
- max endpoint MAX in left subtree is less than lo
  for any interval (a, b) in left subtree of x
  wee hab b <= MAX <= lo
  * b - definition of MAX
  * MAX - reason for going right

if search goes left, then there is either an intersection in left subtree.
or no intersections in either.
- since go left we have lo <= max
- Then for any interval (a, b) in right subtree of x
  hi < c <= a --> no intersection in right
  * hi - no intersection in left subtree
  * c - intervals sorted by left endpoint

~ in either [и в том, и в другом случае]

10.5 RECTANGLE INTERSECTION (8:10)

Orthogonal rectangle intersection search

Goal: Find all intersections among a set of N orthogonal rectangles.
Quadratic algorythm: check all pairs of rectangles for intersection
Nondegeneracy assumprion: All x- and y-coordinates are distinct

Moore's law: Processing power doubles every 18 months.
--> linearythmic algorythm is required to sustain Moore's law

~sustain [выдерживать, быть опорой]
~sweep [отбосить]

Implementation: sweep-line algorythm
    Sweep vertical line from left to right
    - x-coordinats of left and right endpoints define events.
    - maintain the set of rectangles that intersect the sweep line in a interval search tree
      (using y-intervals of rectangle)
    - Left endpoint: interval search for y-interval of rectangle; insert y-interval.
    - right endpoint: remove y-interval.

==> Sweep line algorythm takes time proportional to N log N + R log N to find R interactions among a set of N rectangles
    - put x coord on PQ (or sort) - N log N
    - insert y-intervals to ST - N log N
    - delete y-intervals from ST - N log N
    - interval searches for y-interval - N log N + R log N
==> Sweep line reduces 2D orthogonal rectangle intersection search to 1D interval search

D (13,  5)  ->  (19,  5)  [ horizontal ]
E (15,  9)  ->  (15, 16)  [ vertical   ]
F ( 5,  6)  ->  (11,  6)  [ horizontal ]
G ( 6, 15)  ->  (10, 15)  [ horizontal ]
H ( 2, 12)  ->  (16, 12)  [ horizontal ]


Give the horizontal line segments in the BST (sorted in increasing order of y-coordinate) just before
the sweep-line algorithm processes the vertical line segment B.

(seed = 87971)
What is the level-order traversal of the kd-tree that results after inserting
the following sequence of points into an initially empty tree?

A (0.37, 0.46)
B (0.35, 0.10)
C (0.97, 0.65)
D (0.34, 0.56)
E (0.49, 0.38)
F (0.73, 0.81)
G (0.67, 0.79)

Your answer should be a sequence of uppercase letters, starting with A and separated by whitespace.

Recall that our convention is to subdivide the region using the x-coordinate at even levels
(including the root) and using the y-coordinate at odd levels. Also, we use the left subtree
for points with smaller x- or y-coordinates.
